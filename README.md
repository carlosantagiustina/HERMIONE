<!-- badges: end -->

The HERMIONE shiny dashboard, developed as part of the Social Inequality
Observatory of the MUHAI project, allows you to interactively filter and
explore co-occurrence entity networks, fine-grained narratives analysis,
and case studies on inequality perception using online data from
Twitter, collected in MUHAIâ€™s Observatory Knowledge Graph. With HERMIONE
you can: (i) Gain insights into how specific forms of inequality are
perceived, and understood across time and contexts. (ii) Understand
reactions and dialectical challenges to inequality by individuals,
institutions, and organizations. (iii) Access powerful methods for
retrieving, filtering, aggregating, and analyzing online debates about
inequality from different perspectives.

branch) as follows:
